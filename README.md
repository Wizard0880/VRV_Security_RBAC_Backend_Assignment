# üîê VRV Security RBAC Backend Assignment  

Welcome to the **VRV Security RBAC Backend Assignment**!  
This project demonstrates a robust implementation of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for securing APIs with granular role permissions. üéØ  

---

## üåü Features  

- ‚ú® **Secure Authentication and Authorization**  
  - **Password Hashing**: Protects user credentials using `bcryptjs`.  
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure and stateless user sessions.  
  - **Access and Refresh Tokens**: Ensures both security and session longevity.  
  - **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Adds an additional layer of security against XSS attacks.  

- üë• **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - **User**: Basic access for end-users.  
  - **Moderator**: Extended privileges to manage content and users.  
  - **Admin**: Full control over all resources and users.  

- üîê **API Security**  
  - **Middleware-based Validation**: Ensures APIs are protected with role and permission checks.  
  - **Error Handling**: Unified and developer-friendly error responses for quick debugging.  

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalable Backend Architecture**  
  - Built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, designed for high performance and easy integration.  

- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly Setup**  
  - Simplified installation process.  
  - Intuitive and modular route structure for quick navigation and testing.  

- üìä **Comprehensive Documentation**  
  - Detailed API documentation with ready-to-use JSON payloads for testing in Postman.  
  - Well-commented codebase for easy readability and extensibility.  

- üìà **Scalable Database Integration**
  -  Efficient data storage and retrieval using MongoDB with Mongoose ODM.
  
---

## üõ† Prerequisites  

- **Node.js**: v14.x or higher  
- **npm**: v6.x or higher  
- **MongoDB**: A running instance of MongoDB (local or cloud-based like Atlas)  
- **Postman**: For API testing  
- **Dependencies**: Ensure the following packages are installed:  
  - `bcrypt` (v5.1.1)  
  - `cookie-parser` (v1.4.7)  
  - `dotenv` (v16.4.5)

   - Register a new user:  
     Method: `POST`  
     Endpoint: `/register`  
     Body:  
     ```json
     {
       "fullname": "exampleUser",
       "email":"example@gmail.com",
       "password": "examplePassword",
       "role": "User"
     }
     ```
