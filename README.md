## üõ† Working  

This project demonstrates a secure, professional, and scalable approach to managing user authentication and role-based access control. Below is the detailed working process:  

1. **User Registration**  
   - A new user registers by providing `fullname`, `email`, `password`, and `role` (e.g., `user`, `moderator`, or `admin`).  
   - The `password` is securely hashed using `bcryptjs` before saving to the database.  
   - The user details (`fullname`, `email`, hashed password, and role) are stored in the MongoDB database for future reference.  

2. **Login Process**  
   - A user logs in by providing their `email` and `password`.  
   - The system verifies the credentials by comparing the hashed password with the stored hash.  
   - Upon successful verification, two tokens are generated:  
     - **Access Token**: Short-lived token containing the `role` as part of the payload.  
     - **Refresh Token**: Long-lived token for refreshing access tokens.  
   - The **Access Token** is sent to the user's browser via an HTTP response header, while the **Refresh Token** is saved in the database to ensure database-level authenticity.  
   - An **HTTP-only cookie** is also set for secure session management, adding protection against XSS attacks.  

3. **Access Control**  
   - The **Access Token** is used to authorize API requests.  
   - The token's payload includes the `role`, which is checked by middleware to determine the permissions for a specific route.  
   - Based on the user's role (`user`, `moderator`, `admin`), appropriate access is granted:  
     - **User**: Can create content and perform basic tasks.  
     - **Moderator**: Can review pending content and provide feedback.  
     - **Admin**: Can view logs, update user statuses, and delete users.  

4. **Token Refresh**  
   - When the **Access Token** expires, the **Refresh Token** is used to generate a new Access Token without requiring the user to log in again.  
   - The **Refresh Token** is verified for authenticity against the database before issuing a new Access Token.  

5. **Logout**  
   - The user logs out, clearing the HTTP-only cookies and removing the Refresh Token from the database.  
   - This ensures all tokens are invalidated, preventing unauthorized reuse.  

6. **Role-Based Permissions**  
   - Each API route is protected by middleware that validates the **Access Token** and extracts the user's role from the payload.  
   - Permissions for accessing, creating, updating, or deleting resources are granted strictly based on the role.  

**Scalability:**  
- The system architecture is designed to handle large user bases efficiently with separate handling of access and refresh tokens.  
- Proper use of JWT ensures lightweight, stateless authentication for most requests while retaining database checks for critical operations.
